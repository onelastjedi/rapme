# Rapme

I created this app to demonstrate how to use the modern JavaScript stack for creating full-featured SPA without any self-hosted backend.

Feel free to discuss about whole architecture, pros, cons, etc.

# Continuous integration

You wanna use tools for testing your code automatically (like [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), [Travis](https://travis-ci.org), etc). Then, you can host SPA's as a static website. This app deploying to AWS S3 automatically from CircleCI workflow.

Configuration for test, build and deploy located in [circle.yml](circle.yml).
